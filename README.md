# Password Authenticator

## Overview
This Password Authenticator is a simple Java application developed as part of my coursework for HyperionDev - Lesson 2, CT2. It is designed to demonstrate basic Java programming concepts including input handling, string manipulation, file I/O, and the use of recursive functions.

The application prompts users to enter an email and create a password that meets specific criteria: it must contain at least two numbers, one uppercase letter, and one symbol. Each password attempt, whether successful or not, is recorded in a text file along with the associated email.

## Features
- **User Input for Email and Password**: Prompts users to input their email and create a password.
- **Password Validation**: Ensures that the password meets the specified criteria.
- **Detailed User Feedback**: Informs users about which specific criteria their password is failing to meet.
- **File Writing**: Records every password attempt in a text file.
- **Defensive Programming**: Includes error handling for robust and reliable execution.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Java
- **Environment**: Any IDE that supports Java, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- **Concepts Demonstrated**: Input handling, string validation, recursion, file I/O, defensive programming.

## Project Context
This project is part of my learning journey in HyperionDev's curriculum, specifically for Lesson 2, CT2. It serves as an application of Java programming fundamentals and demonstrates good practices in writing clean, maintainable code.
